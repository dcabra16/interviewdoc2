                    <td>I selected Minh because he is a psychology student who naturally applies project management ideas to everyday life. 
                        He believes that structure is essential and that life becomes chaotic without a plan. 
                        Minh often talks about how organizing tasks and creating routines helps him stay focused and productive. 
                        Even though he is not in healthcare or information technology, his understanding of motivation, behavior, and habit formation makes him a valuable person to speak with for this project. 
                        His perspective offers insight into how personal organization and planning can influence progress.</td>

                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Conversation Summary</strong></td>
                    <td>When I asked Minh how he uses project management in his life, he explained that he organizes most of his personal goals the same way someone would organize a project. He begins by creating a clear plan because he feels that having a plan gives him direction and movement. 
                        If he does not have a plan, he finds himself feeling stuck or overwhelmed.
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                        Minh talked about how breaking tasks into smaller steps is something he learned from both psychology and project management concepts. He said that the mind responds better to smaller goals because they are easier to start and complete.
                        This approach reduces stress and helps him stay consistent over long periods of time.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                        Another insight was that structure reduces stress. Minh explained that when your routine is organized and predictable, you free your mind from unnecessary worries. 
                        This allows you to focus on what truly matters.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                        He also explained that reviewing your progress is essential.
                        Reflection helps you see what is working and what is not working so you can adjust and improve.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                        Finally, Minh reminded me that project management is really a way of thinking. It helps people become more intentional with their time and more confident in their ability to move forward.

                    <td><strong>Key Insights</strong></td>
                    <td>
                        Minh explained that he treats his life like a project, meaning he applies project management principles to his daily routines and long-term goals. He emphasized that creating a clear plan provides direction and helps prevent the sense of chaos that comes from working without structure.
                        Overall, Minh’s perspective demonstrated that project management is not only useful in professional environments, but can also be applied effectively to personal life to support productivity, clarity, and continuous improvement.</td>
